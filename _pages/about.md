I am a Lecturer in the Department of Mechanical and Production Engineering (MPE) at the Islamic University of Technology (IUT), Bangladesh.  
My academic and research interests lie at the intersection of **materials science and engineering**, **thermal systems**, and **computational modeling**.

My current research focuses on:
- **High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs):** Exploring microstructure, deformation mechanisms, creep, and radiation damage using atomistic simulations (LAMMPS).  
- **Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations:** Studying crack propagation, dislocation dynamics, and phase stability of advanced materials.  
- **Multiscale Modeling:** Bridging atomistic simulations with macroscale thermomechanical properties through hybrid MC/MD and integrated computational materials engineering approaches.  

I have published in leading Q1 journals such as *Energy Conversion and Management* and and I am expanding my work toward high-impact materials science publications (e.g., *Acta Materialia*, *MSE-R*).

Beyond research, I am actively engaged in teaching undergraduate courses on **Machine Design**, **Mechanics of Materials**, and **Statics & Dynamics**, while mentoring students in computational materials projects and scientific writing.

My long-term vision is to develop sustainable solutions in **materials design** for extreme environment, while building strong academic-industry collaborations in the field of materials science.
