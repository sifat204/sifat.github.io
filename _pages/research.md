## Master's Thesis
**Enhancing Microstructure and Mechanical Stability of Al₀.₃CoCrFeNi High-Entropy Alloy via Shear-Assisted Solidification**
**Tools:** LAMMPS, OVITO, Python, VESTA  
**Keywords:** Molecular Dynamics, High-Entropy Alloys, Grain Refinement, Dislocation Mechanics, Radiation Damage

 This project investigated how shear flow during solidification affected the atomic structure and mechanical response of Al₀.₃CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloys. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that shear-assisted processing promoted uniform grain nucleation, nanocrystalline structures, and more stable dislocation behavior. Enhanced chemical ordering and reduced dislocation entanglement contributed to an improved strength-ductility balance. Twin-induced and transformation-induced plasticity mechanisms were more active in the refined microstructure. These combined effects led to superior mechanical performance and thermal stability. The results demonstrated the potential of shear-assisted processing for tailoring HEAs for high-performance, high-temperature applications.

This project marks a key milestone in my research development, combining atomic-scale modeling, mechanical property analysis, and radiation damage simulation to address complex challenges in HEA design. It also laid the groundwork for my doctoral research direction.
