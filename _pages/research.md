## Master's Thesis
**Enhancing Microstructure and Mechanical Stability of Al₀.₃CoCrFeNi High-Entropy Alloy via Shear-Assisted Solidification**
**Tools:** LAMMPS, OVITO, Python, VESTA  
**Keywords:** Molecular Dynamics, High-Entropy Alloys, Grain Refinement, Dislocation Mechanics, Radiation Damage

This project investigates the structural evolution and deformation behavior of an equiatomic Al₀.₃CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) under shear-assisted solidification using atomistic simulations. The goal was to explore how shear flow influences grain structure, defect formation, and radiation tolerance in HEAs.
### Methodology 
- Constructed a BCC atomic lattice for Al₀.₃CoCrFeNi using VESTA and LAMMPS input scripts.  
- Applied shear flow during quenching from 3000 K to 300 K using the NVT ensemble.  
- Used Common Neighbor Analysis (CNA) and Radial Distribution Function (RDF) to monitor crystallinity and detect amorphous regions.  
- Conducted uniaxial tensile simulations to extract mechanical properties (stress–strain behavior, Young’s modulus).  
- Computed Warren–Cowley Chemical Short-Range Order (CSRO) parameters to assess atomic-level solute distribution.  
- Simulated radiation impact through Primary Knock-on Atom (PKA) events at different energy levels.  
- Performed nanoindentation to evaluate hardness and characterize sub-surface plasticity.
### Key Observations  
- Shear-assisted solidification resulted in significant grain refinement and high twin boundary density.  
- Fivefold twins and localized amorphous zones were identified using CNA, suggesting enhanced defect tolerance.  
- Room temperature tensile strength ~4.8 GPa; high temperature simulations showed ductility retention.  
- CSRO analysis indicated moderate solute ordering, correlating with improved yield strength.

This project marks a key milestone in my research development, combining atomic-scale modeling, mechanical property analysis, and radiation damage simulation to address complex challenges in HEA design. It also laid the groundwork for my doctoral research direction.
